<h3>RE Sales Assistant Vacancy (vacancyy number 40568)</h3>
<p>I am writing to apply for the position of Sales Assistant at ABC Clothing Ltd, which was advertised on Trade Me on 14 February 2013.</p>

<ul>
<li>Time management and strong organisational skills</li>
<li>High-level customer service and friendly relationship management</li>
<li>Cash handling and sales ability</li>
<li>Motivation and dedication</li>
</ul>
<p>As a Sales Assistant at a busy shoe store, I have been able to build up a strong foundation of customer service skills.
